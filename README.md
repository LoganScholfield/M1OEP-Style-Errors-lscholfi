# M1OEP-Style-Errors-lscholfi

Styles:
  I prefer the styles used in my Style One branch. This styles used braces that started on the same line as the function of statement. This is easier to use becuase it is the default place CLion will put the brackets.
  
  
Errors:
  Compiler:
        Part of my program I struggled with was the creation of the Compatability function in the main.cpp file. I was attempting to get Brain variables from the Glip object and was not using the correct functions and formatting. This took a lot of attempts befor I was allowed to run my code, but trying every combination I could think of eventually worked. After trying a combinatio  I could use the debugger to step into the code to see where the code brought me.
        
 Run Time:
      A non-Compiler error I Was receiving was in my Glip class. I was attempting to use an enum Color as a variable in the class. I defined the enum inside the classes decloration. This would give me errors while trying to run the program. I needed to put the Enum outside of the classes brackets. I was unable to find a fix to this by myself and attended office hours for help.
